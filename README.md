# README

This is a project that essentially boils down to a to-do list.

The app in this repo is deployed at [random-team-generator](https://working-to-do-list.onrender.com/STATIC/)

## Deployment

To Deploy you must create a new web service with the following values:
  * Language: Node
  * Branch: main
  * Root Directory: backend
  * Build Command: npm install
  * Start Command: node server.js

And once you deploy it, type /STATIC/ at the very end. Now you can make your very own to-do list.
